# There is a list of authors on each school staff page; we are looking for each of their names amongst the names of
# all the authors on Enlighten (University wide system). One problem is that the name on the staff page
# may not be the same as the name on Enlighten - because of nicknames, misspellings etc.
# To make sure we find the person, we abbreviate their first name to one initial, keeping their full last name
# and title. This may get us several candidate names, so we choose the one who has most papers associated to the
# school they are supposed to be in. The chosen name may very well be someone else in the same department who happened
# to have more papers. But then when their own name is searched for, it will be abbreviated and the original author
# will come up in the set of candidates again. Since (name, url) pairs that are already present are filtered out,
# the original author will be first in the number of papers in school ranking and will be placed in the dict this time (hopefully).
# This way everyone is accounted for.

# EXAMPLE
# There are 2 people, A and B, that are listed on CS staff page and whose names abbreviate to "Wilson, Dr J".
# They are both on Enlighten, along with 2 other authors C and D whose names also abbreviate to "Wilson, Dr J".
# A is searched for first, giving us 4 candidate (name, url) pairs.
# We sort them by number of papers associated to CS and B comes out on top - her (name, url) tuple is used.
# We then search for B, again giving us the same 4 candidates. Since B is found to already be in the dict,
# we sort the remaining authors (A, C and D), with A coming out on top as she has more papers in CS.
# Thus A is now put in the dict and both A and B are now included, even if they were placed in a different
# order to how they are listed on the staff page.

# Notes:
# Assumption is that the academic title of authors is consistent across staff page and Enlighten.
# Ranks likelihood of being in department by number of papers associated to the department - other measures could
# be used (number of coauthors in department for instance).

# Other strategies to consider here - string similarity measures instead of using abbreviated names.
# This would avoid some name clashes (which would still happen if people had exact same names) but 
# would be more complicated.
